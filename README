Automatically building GlusterFS from sources for Fedora and EPEL


Requirements:

- build server, should be able to use git, run 'make dist' and have 'copr-cli'
  installed (build.gluster.org)
- public upload/download server (download.gluster.org)
- Fedora COPR account and pre-configured repositories
  (http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/devos/ has them)


The workflow to build RPMs from the git repository, looks like this:

1. configure the sources, generate files: ./autogen.sh && ./configure
2. create a tarball with the sources and generated files: make dist
3. create a src.rpm from the tarball: rpmbuild -ts $tarball
4. upload the src.rpm to a public server, so that Fedora COPR can get it
5. instruct COPR to rebuild the src.rpm
6. sync the resulting RPMs to the public server


Configuration

Currently, both autobuild-cron.sh and autobuild-copr.sh contain some
variables that need adjusting for deployment. In future, these options should
be placed in and read from a separate configuration file.

Both scripts need to be saved in $PATH, for example in ~/bin/ and make sure
that they can get executed.

In order to have the copr-cli command functional, it is needed to get an API
key and save it in ~/.config/copr. Get your personal 180 day valid API key from
http://copr.fedoraproject.org/api/ .

In a crontab, add something like this:

    0 0 * * * ~/bin/autobuild-cron.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/autobuild.log


Testing

It is possible to run autobuild-copr.sh locally, without using Fedora COPR. See
the documentation in the script for further details.

For checking the configuration, the autobuild-cron.sh script can get executed
from the commandline. It is useful to capture the output to a log file, just
like is done in the crontab entry above. The building can take a while,
depending on the queue of builds waiting in Fedora COPR, time differs between 5
minutes to 30 minutes, per branch.
